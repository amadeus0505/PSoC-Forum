{"title": "Programming PSoc 5 with CommandLineInterface", "desc": "Hello everbody,\n\ni hope you can help me a little bit.\n\nAt the moment I am trying to program a PSoC 5 (CY8C5268LTI-LP030) with the CommandLineInterface.\nUnfortunatey it isn\u00c2\u00b4t working properly :disappointed_face:\n\nWhat have I done...\n\nAt the moment I am using this commands in a script:\n\n \n\nOpenPort KitProg/0720063201324400 C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Cypress\\Programmer\nHEX_ReadFile \"C:/HexFile/Testfile.hex\"\nSetAcquireMode \"Reset\"\nSetProtocol 8\nSetProtocolClock 152\nSetProtocolConnector 0\nSetPowerVoltage 5.0\n//PowerOn\nDAP_AcquireChip\nPSoC3_EraseAll\nPSoC3_ProgramRowFromHex 0x03 0 0\nDAP_ReleaseChip\nClosePort\nquit\n\nTill the command \"PSoC3_ProgramRowFromHex 0x03 0 0 \" everything looks good. But while using this command I get following error message:\n\n\"PSoC3_ProgramRowFromHex 0x03 0 0\nE\nTimeout of SPC polling. Lost communication with chip (Status = 0x00)\nPSoC3_ProgramRowFromHex 0x03 0 0 returned 80004005\n80004005 OK\"\n\nAnd I am not sure how to fix it. I don\u00c2\u00b4t know the problem... Is there anybody with an idea how to fix it?\n\nQuestion 2:\n\nIs there a command to program the whole hexfile without the rowId and arrayId? For example the command Program(). Unfortunately the UserGuid tells me it is only for PsoC1 :disappointed_face:\n\nAnd is the arrayId 0x03 the correct id?\n\nMany thanks in advance. I hope somebody can help me! :slightly_smiling_face:\n\n \n\nAndo some more informationen.\nI am using a KitProg2 and the programming with PsocCreator oder PscoCProgrammer is working without any problems. So I guess there is no hardwareproblem. ", "id": 0, "comments": [{"comment": "I would do it like so:\r\n    * dont do it\r\n\r\nHave fun\r\namadeus", "author": "amadeus"}]}
