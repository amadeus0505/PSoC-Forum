{"title": "PSOC 5 UART bootloader protocol ", "desc": "I am working with a CY8C5868AXI-LP032 and need to implement a UART bootloader.  I was able to set up a bootloader project with a bootloader block and a UART block and flash it to my device, then set up the bootloadable block in my application and use the windows based Bootloader Host tool to flash the application to my device via UART.  All of that is working without any problem.\r\n\r\nI now need to send the application image to my bootloader via an embedded host.  Where can I find information about the protocol used by the UART bootloader IP block?  I need to know what commands to send to flash and verify the image to the device.\r\n\r\nAlternately, is there an example I can reference for how to take a.cyacd file and send it to a bootloader over UART, so that I can replicate what the Bootloader Host utility is doing in my embedded system?", "id": 2, "author": "amadeus"}
